The original post can be found here at this Reddit Link . The question revolved around parsing a large text file that contained lines that represented an image. To Quote: Each line is encoded as such. The Number at the beginning represents the observation value, the 0's and 1's after the \"im\" represent the bits representing the image and the letter right after represents the output. ... I want to go through every line in the text file and add it as a list of tuples (input, output). In addition the \"_2\" (index value) and \"im\" need to be removed. The text file can be found here: ocr_train.txt Lets start by declaring a namedtuple to store the info in and reading the file into a list and checking out what each line looks like. from collections import namedtuple tup_list = [] LetterData = namedtuple ( 'LetterData' , [ 'input' , 'output' ]) with open ( 'ocr_train.txt' ) as f : text = list ( f ) print ( text [: 1 ]) Output: ['1\\tim00000000000000000000000001110000011111000100011011000011100000011000000110000001100000111000111011111000000000000000000000000000\\to\\t_\\n'] Cool! So it looks like our 'elements' are separated by a tab. Lets split each line by the tab and see what each line looks like. For now we will just loop through lines 7-9 lines. (I chose this to show some normal lines plus one of the \"blank\" lines that are spread throughout the file.) for line in text [ 7 : 10 ]: elements = line . split ( ' \\t ' ) print ( elements ) Output: ['8', 'im00000000000000000000000000000000000011110011100100100001011000011100000110000001100000011000000100000000000000000000000000000000', 'n', '_\\n'] ['9', 'im01111000110000001000000010000000111111110000000100000001000000010000000100000001000000010000000100000011000001100000010000000100', 'g', '_\\n'] ['', '', '', '\\n'] OK.. nice! Except it looks like we have a \"blank line\" that only contains a 'new line' character (the last list item shown above) and the other lines all have a _\\n . Lets change our loop above to get rid of the _\\n 's as we don't need them anyway. for line in text [ 7 : 10 ]: elements = line . strip ( '_ \\n ' ) . split ( ' \\t ' ) print ( elements ) Output: ['8', 'im00000000000000000000000000000000000011110011100100100001011000011100000110000001100000011000000100000000000000000000000000000000', 'n', ''] ['9', 'im01111000110000001000000010000000111111110000000100000001000000010000000100000001000000010000000100000011000001100000010000000100', 'g', ''] ['', '', '', ''] We may as well go one step further and filter out the empty elements in the list. Let's chage our loop one more time. for line in text [ 7 : 10 ]: elements = list ( filter ( None , line . strip ( '_ \\n ' ) . split ( ' \\t ' ))) print ( elements ) Output: ['8', 'im00000000000000000000000000000000000011110011100100100001011000011100000110000001100000011000000100000000000000000000000000000000', 'n'] ['9', 'im01111000110000001000000010000000111111110000000100000001000000010000000100000001000000010000000100000011000001100000010000000100', 'g'] [] Looks good! We still have an empty list but we will deal with that in a moment. Now the user wants the input which is the 2nd element in our list (index =1) less the im at the beginning of it and the output which is the third item (index=2). Lets loop through our text, make sure that our list isn't empty and add our items to our namedtuple for line in text : elements = list ( filter ( None , line . strip ( '_ \\n ' ) . split ( ' \\t ' ))) if elements : tup_list . append ( LetterData ( input = elements [ 1 ] . strip ( 'im' ), output = elements [ 2 ])) print ( * tup_list [: 10 ], sep = ' \\n ' ) Output: LetterData(input='im00000000000000000000000000000000000011110011100100100001011000011100000110000001100000011000000100000000000000000000000000000000', output='n') LetterData(input='im01111000110000001000000010000000111111110000000100000001000000010000000100000001000000010000000100000011000001100000010000000100', output='g') LetterData(input='im00000000000000000000000001110000011111000100011011000011100000011000000110000001100000111000111011111000000000000000000000000000', output='o') LetterData(input='im00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001111110110110111011000110110001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', output='m') LetterData(input='im00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011100110101011101011101010010011000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', output='m') LetterData(input='im00000000000000000000000000000000000000000011000001100000100011001001011011100010000000110000000000000000000000000000000000000000', output='a') LetterData(input='im00000000000000000000000000000000000011100001101000110010111000101110001011000010110000101000000110000001000000000000000000000000', output='n') LetterData(input='im00000000010000000110000001110000010110000110100000101100001001100011001000010010011100101101011010011100101110011110111100000000', output='d') LetterData(input='im00001100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000100000001000000010000001100000010000000100000', output='i') LetterData(input='im00000000000000000000000000000000000011110011100100100001011000011100000110000001100000011000000100000000000000000000000000000000', output='n') After all that our finished script looks like… from collections import namedtuple tup_list = [] LetterData = namedtuple ( 'LetterData' , [ 'input' , 'output' ]) with open ( 'ocr_train.txt' ) as f : text = list ( f ) for line in text : elements = list ( filter ( None , line . strip ( '_ \\n ' ) . split ( ' \\t ' ))) if elements : tup_list . append ( LetterData ( input = elements [ 1 ] . strip ( 'im' ), output = elements [ 2 ])) print ( * tup_list [: 10 ], sep = ' \\n ' )","tags":"This site","url":"first-post.html"},{"title":"Playing With Markdown","text":"print ( \"Hello\" ) >>> Hello","tags":"This site","url":"second-post.html"}]}
