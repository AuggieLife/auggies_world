### Learning From a Non-Professional
Learning python can be both a very satisfying yet also a frustrating journey.  I find that when I run into a situation that I don't understand or need help with I do what most of us out there do. I head over to google, crank-up youtube, hop on my favorite forum, spin up a chat or crack out a book looking for the elusive explaination that will help me with my current coding problem.

Now I appreciate the plethora of information, documentation, tutorials and videos out there and can't thank the selfless authors of these resources for sharing there knowledge enough.  However I find that most of the time I end up having to go to several resources until my problem is solved.  Either the information is below my current understanding level or even more annoying, the author is explaining it in a manner that is either way over my head or simply makes no sense to me.  It seems that most information is either over-coddling or assumes knowledge that I simply don't have.  Videos seem to either drag on and it takes 20min to get to the meat of what I'm looking for or the vlogger simply isn't explaining the content in a way that works for me.

I happen to be slightly older than many beginning programmers and have been away from a structured learning enviroment for a long time so maybe that's the problem.  Maybe a lifetime working in management and sales has altered my learning process to the point that it takes several explainations from different sources for me to finally interpret what I'm reading or watching.  No matter what the reason, I don't think I'm alone.  I am sure I am not the only intelligent person out there that is living in this limbo land.  A land where we feel like we are being talked down to or a land where the content is just slipping over our heads.  We can see it, we just can't quite grasp it!

I have been thinking a lot about this lately and then out of the blue I heard two very interesting quotes within a few hours of each other from two people that I both respect and enjoy listening to and two poeple that come from different segments.

>Write for the past you. I fall into this trap of either trying to write for experts and trying to impress the people that know more than I do which is a bad place to try to be or trying to write for absolute beginners but I haven't been an absolute beginner for a long time so I don't know how to do that.

>"experts, you know, we have this thing called the ”curse of knowledge” which is, you know, it’s hard to know what it’s like to not know something. Once you know something, it’s almost impossible to know what it’s like to not know it"

Hmmm... Maybe I'm not losing my mind!  Now I keep a personal wiki keeping track of what I have learned and often include complete snippets with documentation and code so I can refer back to it and understand what I have actually coded down the line.  I have also been tinkering with short, concise, straight to the point videos that explain a single concept so I can quickly refer to them when I get stuck in a similar situation. These have always been intended to be kept private but the more I think about it maybe it would be of some use for others... kind of a "I got this to work" by a hobbiest programmer for other hobbiest programmers. I by no means consider myself qualified to teach anybody but at the same time they help me out so maybe others can find some value and if not no harm is done.

With that in mind I am in the process of building a simple static blog in Pelican (it's a great learning process) and plan to have it completed by April 1 with plans to then build a more robust and useful site in Django shortly thereafter.

If anybody thinks they might be interested in reading or watching a slightly older non-professional as he progresses through his learning process, please drop me a line to keep me motivated with any comments or suggestions.
